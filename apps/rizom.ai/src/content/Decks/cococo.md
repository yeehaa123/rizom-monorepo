# Community, Collective, Core


## Who are we?


A **band of misfits** combining our skills, networks, and resources without giving up our individual quirks, values, and styles that made us such unique, talented professionals in the first place.


## What do we want to establish?


A **culture** where every person is empowered to explore their passions and hone their unique strengths. This inspires aligned, purpose-driven collaboration that drives positive societal transformation and sustainable financial success. 


## How do misfits fit in?


Every misfit is a potential **innovator**. Yet too often, these creative minds never find the nourishing environment they need to truly flourish. 


## How do we prevent this waste of talent?


By ensuring that **the future of work is play**.


## Why do we call ourselves Rizom?


Our name comes from 'rhizome'. These are plant stem that grow sideways under the ground. A rhizome not only sprouts its own roots and shoots, but also connects to vast fungal networks that link it to other plants and trees, thereby creating an intricate **living ecosystem** beneath our feet.


Rhizomes create resilient ecosystems by:

+ **Sharing** nutrients and resources across the network

+ Surviving and **regenerating** even when parts are damaged

+ Supporting new **growth** from any point in the system

+ **Adapting** quickly to changing environmental conditions


## How does this translate into our way of working?


Our organization is **organic**, **decentralized**, and based on **aligned**interests.


We create a resilient ecosystem by:

+ **Sharing** expertise, resources, and opportunities across our network of professionals

+ **Regenerating** collective value through fair and transparent compensation models

+ **Growing** sustainably through curated connections and meaningful collaborations

+ **Adapting** together by fostering open communication and continuous learning
