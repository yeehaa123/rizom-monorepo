# Community, Collective, Core


## Who are we?


We are a **band of misfits** combining our talents, networks, and resources without giving up our individual quirks, values, and styles that made us such unique, great professionals in the first place.


## Why would you want to work with misfits?


Every misfit is a potential **innovator**. Yet too often, these creative minds never find the nurturing environment they need to truly flourish.


## How will you make misfits work together?


We will ensure that **the future of work is play**.


## Can you elaborate?


We want to establish a **culture** where every person is empowered to explore their passions and hone their unique strengths, leading to aligned, purpose-driven collaboration that drives positive societal transformation and sustainable financial success.Â 


## So, why do we call ourselves Rizom?


Our name comes from "rhizome" - a plant stem that grows sideways under the ground, not only sprouting its own roots and shoots, but also connecting to vast fungal networks that link it to other plants and trees, creating an intricate **living ecosystem** beneath our feet.


## How do they create resilient ecosystems?


+ **Sharing** nutrients and resources across the network

+ Surviving and **regenerating** even when parts are damaged

+ **Supporting** new growth from any point in the system

+ **Adapting** quickly to changing environmental conditions


## How does this manifest in our way of working?


Our organization is **organic**, **decentralized**, and based on shared, aligned **interest**.


## How do we realize this?
