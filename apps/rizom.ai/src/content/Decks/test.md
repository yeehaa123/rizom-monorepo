# The future of work is play


## What are we? 


We are a studio for ecosystem architecture. 


## What the *%@% is that?


Ecosystem Architecture is a regenerative practice that creates and fosters diverse, resilient, effective communities and organizations bound by shared knowledge rather than physical space.


## Again *%@%?


We make communities and organizations a lot better.


## Who are we?


We are a bunch of misfits combining our talents, networks, and resources without giving up our individual autonomy, quirks, values, and styles that made us such unique, great professionals in the first place.


## What is our purpose?


We want to establish a culture where every person is empowered to explore their passions and hone their unique strengths, leading to aligned, purpose-driven collaboration that drives positive societal transformation and sustainable financial success.Â 


## Could we summarize all of that in one sentence?


Sure, we want to make sure that the future of work is play.


## Why aren't we playing yet?


## How do we change the game?


We empower people and organizations to thrive by removing barriers to unlock new possibilities for collaboration.


## What does that mean concretely?


+ Curating meaningful connections

+ Moderating shared spaces 

+ Facilitating personal development


## Can I join Rizom?


Of course, our collective is open to anyone who is excited to join us in our mission.
