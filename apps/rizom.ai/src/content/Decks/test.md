# The future of work is play


## What are we? 


We are a studio for **ecosystem architecture**. 


## What the ★#@☠︎♠︎! does that mean?


Ecosystem Architecture is a regenerative practice that creates and fosters diverse, resilient, effective communities and organizations bound by **shared knowledge** rather than physical space.


## Again, what the ★#@☠︎♠︎! ?


We make **communities and organizations** a lot better.


## Who are we?


We are a **band of misfits** combining our talents, networks, and resources without giving up our individual quirks, values, and styles that made us such unique, great professionals in the first place.


## What is our purpose?


We want to establish a **culture** where every person is empowered to explore their passions and hone their unique strengths, leading to aligned, purpose-driven collaboration that drives positive societal transformation and sustainable financial success. 


## In a single sentence, please?


We will make sure that **the future of work is play**.


## Why do we want that?


The future doesn't need to separate work from play. As technology handles the boring stuff, we get to focus on what we do best: **creating, exploring, and solving puzzles together**. 


## Why aren't we playing yet?


We are **blocked** by preconceived, outdated, misguided notions, tools and practices that tell us what work should look and feel like.


## How do we change the game?


We empower people and organizations to thrive by removing blockages to **unlock new possibilities** for collaboration.


## What does that mean concretely?


+ We **curate** meaningful connections

+ We **moderate** shared spaces 

+ We **facilitate** personal development


## Can we be more specific?


+ We offer **consulting services**

+ We develop **open-source solutions**


## Can I join us?
