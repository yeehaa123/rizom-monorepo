  "summary": "Bio encompasses the study of living systems and their application to various domains. It involves dissecting biological structures, engineering digital patterns, and transforming values into rules. This approach is utilized in course design, focusing on the transition from play to work and the establishment of rule systems. The process includes simulating ecosystems, debugging rule systems, and ultimately releasing control to allow for autonomous governance. Bio-inspired methodologies foster creativity, problem-solving skills, and a deep understanding of complex systems, bridging the gap between natural phenomena and human-designed structures.",
  "excerpt": "Explore the intersection of biology and design, where living systems inspire innovative approaches to work, play, and rule-setting. Discover how bio-inspired methodologies can enhance problem-solving and foster adaptability in various fields."
