  bio: >
    
    I am an entrepreneur, thinker, and coder. Nowadays, I like to call myself an
    ecosystem architect. Concretely, this means that I bring people together
    around common values, discover a shared vision, and translate this into
    effective ecosystems.


    My greatest passion has always been changing the way people learn, and
    challenging preconceived and ill-informed notions of educational
    institutions. With Offcourse, I aim to create an ecosystem of people and
    tools that focus on open and transparent knowledge sharing instead of
    credentials, ego, and intellectual property.


    In 2021, I created the Superconnectors event format that enabled startups to
    present their so-called 'critical ask' to the best-connected people of the
    global tech ecosystem. 


    I holds a PhD in Philosophy from the university of Utrecht and worked as a
    researcher and teacher at several traditional (Utrecht, Berlin, Amsterdam,
    Minneapolis) and non-traditional (DevBootcamp San Francisco) schools. I also
    founded the Innovator's Working Group of the Dutch Internet Society, and was
    actively involved in the Public Spaces Coalition. I strongly advocate for
    impactful and inclusive internet.


    I currently work and live in Taipei, Taiwan.
description: 'The journey to "Share Openly" involves four key steps: sharing a
  vision, opening up perspectives, discussing effectively, and avoiding
  pitfalls. These elements work together to foster transparent communication,
  broaden understanding, facilitate meaningful dialogues, and prevent common
  communication errors. By mastering these skills, individuals can cultivate an
  environment of openness, trust, and productive exchange of ideas.'

    checkpointId: 6712c87566f45c8ee7553793b1c52666
    description: The article explores teardown culture, where people disassemble
      gadgets to understand their inner workings. This practice promotes open
      sharing of knowledge, fostering transparency and innovation. By
      deconstructing devices, individuals gain insights into technology,
      encouraging a culture of curiosity and collaborative learning.

    checkpointId: 984c5648ca6365ab85614aac790f5961
    description: Sharing work-in-progress fosters open communication, invites
      feedback, and builds connections. It allows others to learn from your
      process, encourages collaboration, and helps you refine ideas. By
      publishing unfinished work, you embrace vulnerability, demonstrate growth,
      and contribute to a culture of transparency and continuous improvement.

    checkpointId: 3119828c28bc7a4df9bc2408ca979803
    description: Remixing existing designs fosters open sharing by encouraging
      designers to build upon and transform others' work. This approach promotes
      collaboration, sparks creativity, and leads to innovative solutions. By
      remixing, designers openly share their interpretations and improvements,
      contributing to a culture of knowledge exchange and collective growth in
      the design community.

    description: The article on RISC-V architecture exemplifies open sharing by
      detailing a freely available, open-source instruction set architecture.
      This aligns with the goal of sharing openly and the task of releasing
      blueprints, as RISC-V's open nature allows for collaborative development
      and widespread adoption in processor design.
