Over the last three months, we have accomplished significant exploratory work in developing our collective. This has led to several tangible and important achievements:

- Grow from 1 to 10+ ambassadors

- Successful dissemination of our vision through LinkedIn

- Development and population of the Offcourse Platform

- Creation and testing of the Cora Methodology

- Definition of our collective purpose, mission, and vision

Among these achievements, the definition of our purpose stands as the most crucial milestone for me. Through Iré's work, we have crystallized our collective purpose into a simple yet powerful statement:

> The future of work is play

Like many of you, I acknowledge there is still a considerable journey ahead to transform this vision into reality — even within our own collective. Currently, work hardly ever feels like play to me. This isn't a complaint, but rather an important acknowledgment. If we are truly committed to this purpose, one question should guide everything we do: "Does this feel like play to us?" If the answer is no, we should hold ourselves and each other accountable.

This leads to a fundamental question: What do we mean by play? And perhaps more importantly: Does play mean the same to everyone? While the answer to the second question is a clear no, playing feels different to everyone, we can identify three distinct modes of play that Rizom should facilitate:

1. **Child's Play** (artistic/free play)
   - The purest form of play
   - Our ultimate aspiration
   - Driven by curiosity and joy

2. **Competitive Play** (gamification)
   - Structured play that creates engagement
   - A bridge toward free play
   - Channels our natural desire for achievement

3. **Power Play** (politics)
   - Strategic play that protects our vision
   - Essential for sustainable change
   - Acknowledges the reality of organizational dynamics

While free play represents our ultimate goal, we must acknowledge that contemporary workplaces are far from equipped to accommodate this mode. Gamification can serve as a stepping stone, using healthy competition to help people discover the value of genuine play. Meanwhile, we must sometimes also engage in power play to defend and advance our vision against deeply ingrained notions and interests around work.

This last point may be controversial, but I believe it is crucial. In order to make sure that work can actually remain play, it is important to defend it against the outside world where there are powerful forces invested in maintaining the status quo. Denying the political aspect of what we are doing is not going to make it more free. Quite the opposite, in fact.

Moving forward, our focus must be on creating fertile ground that allows our collective to grow and prosper. Only then can we truly embody our purpose and transform the future of work.


## OKRs

### Objective: Make Rizom Sustainable

The collective's objective for the first three months is to ensure that we can financially and organizationally sustain and grow in 2025. The responsibility to reach and define this objective must be proven to be shared collectively; otherwise, our experiment would be unsuccessful and subsequent conclusions should be drawn.

Moving forward, we no longer put deadlines on phases but on results. Similarly, people are not grouped on an activity level but on a result level. These results will be ranked using Fabia's Cora's methodology and compensated accordingly (tbd)

We will prioritize results not simply on their perceived importance, but primarily on the willingness of collective members to contribute and commit to them, since this has proven to be the main bottleneck so far. It is easy to decide what other people should do, but that is not the way we want to operate.

To kick things off, I made a list of upcoming results that need to be completed in order to reach our objective. This list is neither complete, sufficiently detailed, or properly prioritized. 

For myself, I already marked where I want to:
